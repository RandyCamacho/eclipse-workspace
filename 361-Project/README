Deterministic Finite Automata
Randy Camacho
CS-361 Section-3
Semester: Spring 2019

##Overview
A java program that models a deterministic finite automaton.

##Compiling
From the command line to compile cd into the directory with all the folders and files.
Run the command: javac fa/dfa/DFADriver.java

##Discussion
I found the implementation of this project to be a challenge at first but once I figured out how to 
correctly implement the hash map and hash sets things went smoothly. The most difficult part of this assignment
was implementing the toString method and making it match up with the porject description.

##Testing
To test my program I first compiled the program then ran it with the files that were 
provided and made sure that the output matched what the description wanted.
The command I used to Test the program: java fa.dfa.DFADriver ./tests/p1tc1.txt
