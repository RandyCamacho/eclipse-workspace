Grammar

##Compile and Testing
To compile go to the file directory and run the command javac *.java
To run and test the program cd into the test folder with: cd test then run the command: ./run
all the test files should run. Errors or failures will appear if the tests failed.

##Discussion
I found this project to be extremely difficult and tough to get through. It took some time but I believe I got it to work the 
way it was suppose to. I made more test files to test the new grammar and make sure that it ran the way it was supposed to.
