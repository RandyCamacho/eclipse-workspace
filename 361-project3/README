CS-361
Project 3

##Overview
Reads in a regular expression and turns it into a NFA

##Compiling and Running
To compile from the top directory
javac -cp ".:./CS361FA.jar" re/REDriver.java

to run after the jar file is included
java -cp ".:./CS361FA.jar" re.REDriver ./tests/p3tc1.txt

##Discussion
The link that was provided helped me with this project a lot. It provided
a good skeleton to use and with some trial and error I was able to add the 
few changes and produce the correct output. I began by looking through the 
provided link and implementing the functions that I could. I then added the 
addirional lines of code to be able to create the nfa. Being able to use 
the nfa and dfa libraries made it much easier to implement the machine. One
of the diffculties I had was when dealing with the choice function and needing
to get the final states but I was able to figure it out by using a foreach loop
and using the libraries that were provided. 

##Testing
To test this program I ran it with all the different test files that were provided
and made sure that I was getting the right output.
