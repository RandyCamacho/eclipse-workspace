Project 2 CPU Scheduling Simulation
CS 321

Overview:
Implements a Priority Queue using a Max Heap. Simulates CPU round robin
scheduling.

Included Files:
CPUScheduling.java - source file
Averager.java - source file
ProcessGenerator.java - source file
Process.java - source file
MaxHeap.java - source file
PQueue.java - source file
README - this file

Compiling and Running:
To compile the files use the command javac *.java
Once the files have been compiled the program can be ran by using the 
usage - java CPUScheduling <maxProcessTime> <maxPriorityLevel> <timeToIncrementPriority> 
<simulationTime> <processArrivalRate>

Example - java CPUScheduling 5 5 5 100 0.4

Program design and Important concepts:
This program contains six source files all with different parts to the 
program. CPUScheduling.java simulates the round robin CPU Scheduling algorithm.
Averager.java keeps track of the number of processes in the simulation
and computes the average turn around time. ProcessGenerator.java randomly
generates processes with a given probability. Process.java defines a process.
MaxHeap.java defines a max-heap. Pqueue.java defines a priority queue using
max-heap.

Testing:
To test my program I ran it with the example input and made sure it 
produced the correct output. I ensured that the program would run with
different valid inputs. I also made sure that bad input would result
in the printing of a usage statement.
