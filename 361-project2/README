NFA
Randy Camacho
CS-361 Section 3

##Overview
A java program that mimics a NFA

##Compiling and Running
From the command line to compile cd into the directory with all the folders and files.
Run the command: javac fa/nfa/NFADriver.java
To run the program use the command: java fa.nfa.NFADriver <input file>


##Discussion
I found this project to be challenge especially when it came to implementing the getDFA method.
I ran into countless amounts of null pointer errors but was eventually able to get it working.
From the feedback I got from part 1 of the project I did my best to use more object oriented 
principles.

##Testing 
To test my program I ran it with the test cases that were provided and made sure that it was producing 
what was expected.
