Project 1: Cache

Author: Randy Camacho
Class: CS321

Overview
This program works as a Cache implemented using a linked list.

Compiling and Using
To compile this program first compile Cache.java using the command
javac Cache.java. Next compile Test.java using javac Test.java.
Once both classes are compiled the program can be used in two 
different ways: java Test 1 <cache size> <input textfile name> or
java Test 2 <1st-level cache size> <2nd-level cache size> <input textfile name>
